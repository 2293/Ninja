You can view introduction at `Setting/Others/Version` after close this page.

Basically Ninja is a simple web browser like any others, but there are some different things you need to know.

## Switch tabs:

![tab_switcher.png](tab_switcher.png "tab_switcher.png")

 - Press the __address bar__ and __drag it down__, then the fashion tab switcher will display.

 - __Swipe up/down__ to dimiss a page.

__Remember__ that if the soft keyboard is shown the tab switcher would not display, it's our design :)

## Load in background when you click links in other App:

 1. Set Ninja as your __default browser__ when click links.

 2. __Single tap__ will open links in background, and show a clickable notification in statusbar.

 3. __Double taps__ will show a dialog that allows you to open links in foreground, etc.

## Screenshot:

Ninja supports __capture entire webpage__ function, but that is not means you could screenshot a long long long webpage, because __OOM__, etc.

## Bookmarks:

Before you update Ninja for new version I suggest you to backup your bookmarks in `Setting/Data/Export bookmarks`.

And you can recover your bookmarks by `Setting/Data/Import bookmarks` :)
